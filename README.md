JS Data Structure References
----------------------------

Stacks: LIFO
Queues: FIFO

Sets: unique sequential [key, key]
Maps/Dictionaries: [key, value]
Hashes/Hashe Tables/Hash Maps: constant time look-up 

WeakMaps/WeakSets: similar to their non-Weak conterparts with omited iterator methods; only possible to use objects as keys; weakly typed, which means is possible for garbage collection for performance.

Linked-lists: consists of nodes that point a reference to the next element.
Doubly-linked-list:
Circular-linked-list:
Doubly-circular-linked-list:

Trees: non-sequential data structure that is useful for storing information that need to be found easily; hiearchyal relationship;

Graphs: non-linear data structure; abstract model of a network struture; a set of nodes connected by edges.
