JS Data Structure References
----------------------------

Stacks: LIFO (Last In First Out)
Used for backtracking problems to remember tasks or paths visited, and to undo actions
    * decimal to binary problem
    * the balanced parenthesis problem
    * the tower of Hanoi problem





Queues: FIFO (First In First Out)
* Priority queue
* Circular queue i.e. Hot Potato Game





Linked-lists: consists of nodes that point a reference to the next element; advantage over an array is that you can easily add/remove elements without shifting over its elements.
Variations: 
* doubly
* circular
* doubly circular





Sets: unordered, unique sequential data structure -- DOES NOT ALLOW DUPLICATES VALUES [key, key]
* Union
* Intersection
* Difference
* Subset





Maps/Dictionaries: [key, value]
Hashes/HasheTables/HashMaps: constant time look-up (NON-SEQUENTIAL)
- handle hashTable collision with linear probing or linked list implementation





WeakMaps/WeakSets: similar to their non-Weak conterparts with omited iterator methods; only possible to use objects as keys; weakly typed, which means is possible for garbage collection for performance.





Trees: non-sequential data structure that is useful for storing information that need to be found easily; hiearchyal relationship;
Tree traversal:
* In-order traversal
* Pre-order traversal: visits the node prior to its descendants
* Post-order traversal: visits the node after it visits its descendants

Searching for values in a tree
* Searching for the min value
* Searching for the max value
* Searching for a specific value




Graphs: non-linear data structure; abstract model of a network struture; a set of nodes connected by edges.
