ES6 Map class values and keys methods return an Iterator; it has a size property and a delete method.

The difference between the Map or Set classes and their Weak versions are:
   * The WeakSet or WeakMap classes do not have the entries, keys, and values methods (essentially, they don't have methods that returns an Iterator)
   * It is only possible to use Objects as a key for the weak versions.

The reason for creating and using the weak variants are performance related.
